    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    // name = 'Bobby';
    // console.log(name, name2); // Bobby Bob

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // team is a reference to the original players array
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Testing';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = { ...person };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const joe = {
      name: 'Joe',
      age: 123,
      social: {
        twitter: '@joe',
        facebook: 'joe.fb'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(joe);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, joe);

    // "Poor man's deep clone"
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(joe));
